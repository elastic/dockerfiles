## About this Repository

This repo is used to store the Dockerfile which can be used to build an
Elasticsearch Docker image. The Dockerfile was generated from the [Elasticsearch
repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). Please note that **issues
are disabled on this repo** and that all issues and PRs must be filed in the
[Elasticsearch repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch).

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of
solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it
centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the
unexpected.
