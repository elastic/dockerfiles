# Dockerfiles

## About this Repository

This repo is used to store the Dockerfile which can be used to build an
Elasticsearch and a Kibana Docker image. The Dockerfile was generated from their 
related repositories [Elasticsearch repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch), 
[Kibana repository](https://github.com/elastic/kibana). Please note that **issues
are disabled on this repo** and that all issues and PRs must be filed in the repositories 
above mentioned.

**Elasticsearch** is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of
solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it
centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the
unexpected.

For more information about Elasticsearch, please visit
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch.

**Kibana** lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, 
so you can do anything from learning why you're getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to 
understanding the impact rain might have on your quarterly numbers.
